🔒 Security System using C++
📌 Introduction
This project is a Security System implemented in C++, designed to provide authentication and access control features. It utilizes password protection, motion detection, and logging mechanisms to ensure security.

🚀 Features
🔑 User Authentication – Secure login with password verification
🎥 Motion Detection – Detects movement using sensors (if integrated with hardware)
📜 Activity Logging – Records access attempts with timestamps
🔔 Alert System – Notifies unauthorized access attempts
🛡️ Encryption – Encrypts stored credentials for security
🏗️ Technologies Used
C++ (Core programming language)
OpenCV (For motion detection, if required)
File Handling (To store user credentials & logs)
Cryptography Libraries (For password encryption)
